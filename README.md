# ansible-role-openvpn-ldap

Role for deploy OpenVPN server with AD/LDAP and/or OTP plugins support.

## Requirements

* Ansible 3.0.0;
* OpenVPN 2.4+ with builtin `openvpn-client`/`openvpn-server` systemd services;
* SMTP server for send to end-users configuration;
* CA storage, is two options:
 * `file` - this may be tiny Linux VM as delegated host. All certificate issuing
will be maked on this host;
 * `s3` - Amazon S3 bucket. All certificate issuing will be maked on
deployment host;

## Scenarios:

***openvpn_scenario*** variable should be defined, it can be:
* `deploy_instance` - this scenario is for client/server (or both) deployment;
* `deploy_user` - this scenario is for end user, plays like:
  * checks user is present in LDAP;
  * asserts that user `mail` field is e-mail;
  * generates configuration and certs for this user;
    * optionally with inline certs/keys support in one '\*.ovpn' profile for
      compatibility with GUI clients (profile import)
  * makes archive;
  * sends archive to user e-mail address.

## Certificate Revocation List (CRL) support (only when CA storage is S3)

Optionally with this role is possible to revoke generated certs, playbooks
should look like this:

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy Certificate Revocation List
  become: false
  gather_facts: false
  remote_user: ansible
  no_log: false
  strategy: free
  roles:
  - /home/k0ste/sandbox/GIT/ansible-role-openvpn-ldap
  vars_prompt:
   - name: 'openvpn_revoke_target'
     prompt: 'What instance name should be revoked?'
     private: no
  hosts:
  - localhost
```

## Example configuration of server with 4 tunnels

- First instance (openvpn1194) have client-config-dir.
- All clients receive routes.
- Special clients receive dedicated ipaddr.
- Last instance (openvpn1198) allow only one connection per user.

# Enable a management server on a socket-name Unix socket on those platforms

# management link can operate over the tunnel itself. To enable this mode, set
# IP to tunnel. Tunnel mode will cause the management interface to listen for a
# TCP connection on the local VPN address of the TUN/TAP interface. While the
# management port is designed for programmatic control of OpenVPN by other
# applications, it is possible to telnet to the port, using a telnet client in
# "raw" mode. Once connected, type "help" for a list of commands.

# A helper directive designed to simplify the expression of 'ping' and

# it is enough to add this on the server side as it will push appropriate --ping
# and --ping-restart options to the client. If used on both server and client,
# the values pushed from server will override the client local values. The
# timeout argument will be twice as long on the server side. This ensures that
# a timeout is detected on client side before the server side drops the
# connection. For example, "keepalive: 10 60" expands as follows:
# if mode server:
#   ping 10                    # Argument: interval
#   ping-restart 120           # Argument: timeout*2

# If specified, this directive will cause OpenVPN to immediately forget
# username/password inputs after they are used. As a result, when OpenVPN needs
# a username/password, it will prompt for input from stdin, which may be
# multiple times during the duration of an OpenVPN session. When using in
# combination with a user/password file and 'chroot' or 'daemon', make sure to
# use an absolute path.
    auth_nocache: 'true'
# Renegotiate data channel key after n seconds (default is '3600)'. When using
# dual-factor authentication, note that this default value may cause the end
# user to be challenged to reauthorize once per hour. Also, keep in mind that
# this option can be used on both the client and server, and whichever uses the
# lower value will be the one to trigger the renegotiation. A common mistake is
# to set 'reneg_sec' to a higher value on either the client or server, while
# the other side of the connection is still using the default value of '3600'
# seconds, meaning that the renegotiation will still occur once per 3600
# seconds. The solution is to increase 'reneg_sec' on both the client and
# server, or set it to 0 on one side of the connection (to disable), and to
# your chosen value on the other side.
    reneg_sec: '0'
# Enable a compression algorithm. The algorithm parameter may be 'lzo', 'lz4'.
# LZO and LZ4 are different compression algorithms, with LZ4 generally offering
# the best performance with least CPU usage. For backwards compatibility with
# OpenVPN versions before v2.4, use 'lzo'.
    compress: 'lzo'
# Set output verbosity (default is '1'). Each level shows all info from the
# previous levels. Level '3' is recommended if you want a good summary of
# whatâ€™s happening without being swamped by output. '0' â€” no output except
# fatal errors.
# '1' to '4' â€” Normal usage range.
# '5' - output R and W characters to the console for each packet read and
# write, uppercase is used for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase is used for
# TUN/TAP packets.
# '6' to '11' - Debug info range.

# Don't re-read key files across SIGUSR1 or 'ping-restart'. This option can be
# combined with "user: 'nobody' to allow restarts triggered by the SIGUSR1
# signal. Normally if you drop root privileges in OpenVPN, the daemon cannot be
# restarted since it will now be unable to re-read protected key files.
# This option solves the problem by persisting keys across SIGUSR1 resets, so
# they don't need to be re-read.
    persist_key: 'true'
# This directive offers policy-level control over OpenVPN's usage of external
# programs and scripts. Lower level values are more restrictive, higher values
# are more permissive
# '0' - strictly no calling of external programs
# '1' - only call built-in executables such as ifconfig, ip, route, or netsh
# (default)
# '2' - allow calling of built-in executables and user-defined scripts
# '3' - allow passwords to be passed to scripts via environmental variables
# (potentially unsafe)
